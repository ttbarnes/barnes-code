  UX_DESIGN: (
    <p>
      Understanding user needs and potential behaviours is essential for delivering a seemless experience.
      After gaining some insights, we can start creating multiple designs for further feedback, testing and iterations.
      This also enables us to plan MVP and technical requirements.
    </p>,
  ),
  ENGINEERING: (
    <p>
      We strive on creating clean and scalable technical solutions. By following a very modular approach and going above industry standards, the features and functionality we build can be easily maintained, adapted and used in different areas.
    </p>
  ),
  REPLATFORMING: (
    <p>
      We are experts at delivering re-platformed and digital transformation projects. After understanding existing solutions that are in place, we can transform products or services into modern solutions whilst greatly simplifying and improving user journeys.
